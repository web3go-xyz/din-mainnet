## TL;DR

This is the primary place where [Optimism](https://optimism.io) works on stuff related to [Optimistic Ethereum](https://research.paradigm.xyz/optimism).

## Documentation

Extensive documentation is available [here](http://community.optimism.io/docs/).

## Directory Structure

* [`packages`](./packages): Contains all the typescript packages and contracts
    * [`contracts`](./packages/contracts): Solidity smart contracts implementing the OVM
    * [`core-utils`](./packages/core-utils): Low-level utilities and encoding packages
    * [`common-ts`](./packages/common-ts): Common tools for TypeScript code that runs in Node
    * [`hardhat-ovm`](./packages/hardhat-ovm): Hardhat plugin which enables the [OVM Compiler](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/solidity)
    * [`smock`](./packages/smock): Testing utility for mocking smart contract return values and storage
    * [`data-transport-layer`](./packages/data-transport-layer): Event indexer, allowing the `l2geth` node to access L1 data
    * [`batch-submitter`](./packages/batch-submitter): Daemon for submitting L2 transaction and state root batches to L1
    * [`message-relayer`](./packages/message-relayer): Service for relaying L2 messages to L1
* [`l2geth`](./l2geth): Fork of [go-ethereum v1.9.10](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/v1.9.10) implementing the [OVM](https://research.paradigm.xyz/optimism#optimistic-geth).
* [`integration-tests`](./integration-tests): Integration tests between a L1 testnet, `l2geth`,
* [`ops`](./ops): Contains Dockerfiles for containerizing each service involved in the protocol,
as well as a docker-compose file for bringing up local testnets easily

## Development Quick Start

### Setup

Clone the repository, open it, and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
cd optimism
yarn install
```

### Building the TypeScript packages

To build all of the [TypeScript packages](./packages), run:

```bash
yarn clean
yarn build
```

Packages compiled when on one branch may not be compatible with packages on a different branch.
**You should recompile all packages whenever you move from one branch to another.**
Use the above commands to recompile the packages.

### Building the rest of the system

If you want to run an Optimistic Ethereum node OR **if you want to run the integration tests**, you'll need to build the rest of the system.

```
cd ops
export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 # these environment variables significantly speed up build time
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
docker-compose build
```

This will build the following containers:
* [`builder`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereumoptimism/builder): used to build the TypeScript packages
* [`l1_chain`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereumoptimism/hardhat): simulated L1 chain using hardhat-evm as a backend
* [`deployer`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereumoptimism/deployer): process that deploys L1 smart contracts to the L1 chain
* [`dtl`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereumoptimism/data-transport-layer): service that indexes transaction data from the L1 chain
* [`l2geth`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereumoptimism/l2geth): L2 geth node running in Sequencer mode
* [`verifier`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereumoptimism/go-ethereum): L2 geth node running in Verifier mode
* [`relayer`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereumoptimism/message-relayer): helper process that relays messages between L1 and L2
* [`batch_submitter`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereumoptimism/batch-submitter): service that submits batches of Sequencer transactions to the L1 chain
* [`integration_tests`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereumoptimism/integration-tests): integration tests in a box

If you want to make a change to a container, you'll need to take it down and rebuild it.
For example, if you make a change in l2geth:

```bash
cd ops
docker-compose stop -- l2geth
docker-compose build -- l2geth
docker-compose start l2geth
```

For the typescript services, you'll need to rebuild the `builder` so that the compiled
files are re-generated, and then your service, e.g. for the batch submitter

```bash
cd ops
docker-compose stop -- batch_submitter
docker-compose build -- builder batch_submitter
docker-compose start batch_submitter
```

Source code changes can have an impact on more than one container.
**If you're unsure about which containers to rebuild, just rebuild them all**:

```
cd ops
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Finally, **if you're running into weird problems and nothing seems to be working**, run:

```
cd optimism
yarn clean
yarn build
cd ops
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

#### Viewing docker container logs
By default, the `docker-compose up` command will show logs from all services, and that
can be hard to filter through. In order to view the logs from a specific service, you can run:

```
docker-compose logs --follow <service name>
```

### Running tests

Before running tests: **follow the above instructions to get everything built.**

#### Running unit tests

Run unit tests for all packages in parallel via:

```bash
yarn test
```

To run unit tests for a specific package:

```bash
cd packages/package-to-test
yarn test
```

#### Running integration tests

Follow above instructions for building the whole stack.
Build and run the integration tests:

```bash
cd integration-tests
yarn build:integration
yarn test:integration
```

## Additional Reference Material
### Running contract static analysis

We perform static analysis with [`slither`](https://github.com/crytic/slither).
You must have Python 3.x installed to run `slither`.
To run `slither` locally, do:

```bash
cd packages/contracts
pip3 install slither-analyzer
yarn test:slither
```
