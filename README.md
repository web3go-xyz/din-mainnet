Cannon *(cannon cannon cannon)* is an onchain MIPS instruction emulator.
Cannon supports EVM-equivalent fault proofs by enabling Geth to run onchain,
one instruction at a time, as part of an interactive dispute game.

* It's Go code
* ...that runs an EVM
* ...emulating a MIPS machine
* ...running compiled Go code
* ...that runs an EVM

For more information, see [Docs](./docs/README.md).

## Directory Layout

```
contracts -- A MIPS emulator implementation, using merkleized state and a pre-image oracle.
example   -- Example programs that can be run and proven with Cannon.
extra     -- Extra scripts and legacy contracts, deprecated.
mipsevm   -- Go tooling to test the onchain MIPS implementation, and generate proof data.
diffmips  -- MIPS diff testing, to ensure correctness of the main Cannon implementation, with isolated dependencies. 
```

## Building

### `contracts`

The contracts are compiled with [`forge`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).
```
make contracts
```
