The cannon (cannon cannon cannon) is an on chain interactive dispute engine implementing EVM-equivalent fault proofs.

It's half geth, half MIPS, and whole awesome.

* It's Go code
* ...that runs an EVM
* ...emulating a MIPS machine
* ...running compiled Go code
* ...that runs an EVM

For more information on Cannon's inner workings, check [this overview][overview].

## Directory Layout

```
contracts -- A MIPS emulator implementation, using merkleized state and a pre-image oracle.
example   -- Example programs that can be run and proven with Cannon.
extra     -- Extra scripts and legacy contracts, deprecated.
mipsevm   -- Go tooling to test the onchain MIPS implementation, and generate proof data.
unicorn   -- Sub-module, used by mipsevm for offchain MIPS emulation.
```

## Building

Pre-requisites: Go, Node.js, Make, and CMake.
