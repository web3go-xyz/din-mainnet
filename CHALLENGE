Two oracles:
Implement as three MIPS instructions

InputOracle -- Preagreed upon inputs
  $a0 = input choice
    0 -- StateRoot(n)
    1 -- Transactions(n+1)
    2 -- Coinbase(n+1)
    3 -- Uncles(n+1)
  $a1 = shift amount
  returns
  $v0 = inputs[$a0] >> $a1

PreimageOracle -- key value store
  $a0 = dword index in value
  $t0 = hash[31:0]
  $t1 = hash[63:32]
  $t2 = hash[95:64]
  $t3 = hash[127:96]
  $t4 = hash[159:128]
  $t5 = hash[191:160]
  $t6 = hash[223:192]
  $t7 = hash[255:224]
  returns
  $v0 = preimage[$t7...$t0] >> ($a0 * 32)

Program returns a hash in [$t7...$t0] and exits(special instruction) with the hash in the state

Challenge Flow:
C is challenger, D is defender
Super nice, the defender barely needs to spend gas!

C: InitiateChallenge(bytes blockHeaderN, bytes blockHeaderNp1,
                     bytes32 assertionHash, bytes32 finalSystemHash, string[] assertionProof, uint256 stepCount)
  * checks hashes of the block headers
  * saves inputs for input oracle
  * confirms assertionHash != blockHeaderNp1.Hash
  * expectCorrect = (assertionHash == blockHeaderNp1.Hash)
  * confirm assertionProof proves the final state of [$t7...$t0] in finalSystemHash is assertionHash
  * confirm assertionProof proves the final state of *$pc in finalSystemHash is special exit instruction
  * L = 0, R = stepCount-1   # we agree at L=0, we disagree at R=stepCount
  * return new challengeId
  * assertedRiscState[0] = GlobalStartSystemHash
  * assertedRiscState[stepCount-1] = finalSystemHash
C: ProposeRiscState(uint256 challengeId, uint256 riscState)
  * stepNumber = GetStepNumber(uint256 challengeId) returns floor((L + R) / 2)
  * assert assertedRiscState[stepNumber] == 0
  * assertedRiscState[stepNumber] = riscState
D: RespondRiscState(uint256 challengeId, bool yes) onlyOwner
  * off-chain: run to step = stepNumber, get state hash, check if it matches
  * if yes:
      L = stepNumber     # we agree at stepNumber
    else:
      R = stepNumber     # we disagree at stepNumber
    # issue is between [L...R]
........
binary search until L+1 == R
the issue is with the L->R transition
aka assertedRiscState[L] -> assertedRiscState[R]
........
# call this at any time (global), adds them to a preimage lookup for PreimageOracle
C: ProposePreimage(bytes anything)
  * preimageLookup[keccak256(anything)] = anything
C: ConfirmStateTransition(uint256 challengeId, ustrings proofs)
  * assert L+1 == R
  * validate all proofs in assertedRiscState[L]
  * do the state transition
  * if any needed pieces of start state are missing, challenge fails (it can try again)
  * reconstruct the riscState after transition -> newRiscState 
  * assert assertedRiscState[R] == newRiscState
  * pay out bounty
