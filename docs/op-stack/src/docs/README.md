lang: en-US

The OP Stack is the decentralized development stack that powers Optimism. The current release of the OP Stack (named “Bedrock”) was designed to facilitate the creation of L2 blockchains that can interoperate with the proposed [Optimism Superchain](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/fLk5UGjZDiXFuvQh6R_HscMQuuY9ABYNF7PI76-qJYs). The Superchain is a proposed network of rollups that share a security model, communication protocols, and a common development stack (the OP Stack itself). **The best way to get started building with the OP Stack today is to launch your own Bedrock-based Rollup by following our guide to [Getting started with an OP Stack chain](./build/getting-started.md)**. Bedrock Rollups will be compatible with the Superchain.
